            <h2>Electrical Circuit Elements (R, L, and C)</h2>
            <p>
                Electrical circuits consist of various components, including resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). Resistors oppose the flow of electric current, inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them, and capacitors store energy in an electric field. Each of these elements plays a critical role in the behavior of electrical circuits.

                Voltage sources provide a constant potential difference in a circuit, while current sources supply a constant current. Understanding these sources is crucial for analyzing and designing electrical circuits. Voltage sources can be ideal or practical, and similarly, current sources can be modeled based on their ideal or real characteristics.
